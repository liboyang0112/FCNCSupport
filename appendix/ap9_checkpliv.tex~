\section{PLIV cut efficiency study for electron and muon from $\tau$ decays}
\label{sec:CheckPLIV}

The PLIV has been trained to better reject non-prompt leptons and fakes produced in hadron decays. Since tau has a finite lifetime, we have to check the
recommended PLIV scale factors can be applied to the electron and muon from tau decays using $Z\rightarrow \tau\tau\rightarrow e\mu$ enriched control sample
where the electron and muon is required to back-to-back ($d\phi_{e\mu}>2.9$). The data are in good agreement well with the MC prediction with and without
PLIV cuts with the recommended PLIV SF for the invariant mass of electron and muon between 50 and 85 GeV as shon in Figure~\ref{fig:ap9_checkpliv}.

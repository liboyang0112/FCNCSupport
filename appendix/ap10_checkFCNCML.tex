\section{Study on HVV multilepton signal samples}
\label{sec:HVVML}

In this appendix, we presented the FCNC tHq interaction in diboson final state, considering the leptonic decays of W/Z bosons, some fraction of HVV events will contribute to our final state in the lepton+$\thad$ channels as shown in Figures \ref{fig:check_tuH_HWW} - \ref{fig:check_tcH_HWW} while the contamination is
small to the lepton + $\thadhad$ channel.

However, it is not easy to take them into account for signal as the systematics samples are missing. We will not consider the HVV contribution as signal for now
and focus on the $H\rightarrow \tau\tau$ decay only. This would make our limits more conservative if no excess is observed. But in case an exces
s is observed, the contribution should be accounted to properly measure the signal strength.

%A dedicated BDT training using HVV signal samples is performed independent of the nominal one given that the different kinematics distribution betwwen the Htautau and HVV signal samples. BDT discriminant variable for HVV samples are shown in Figure \ref{fig:check_BDT_HWW}.

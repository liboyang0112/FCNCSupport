\section{Study on kinematics fit}
\label{sec:kine}

The kinematics fit method with Higgs mass constraint was developed for our previous run2 analysis with 36 fb$^{-1}$, where Higgs mass term is introduced
in the $\chi^2$ function. The advantage of this type of fit is able to constrain the tau kinematics better than other di-tau kinematic fits such as MMC and
a collinear fit without Higgs mass constraint. The bias on the background shape is also checked using the same-sign di-tau events where the data are well modelled
by the Monte Carlo. We also repeated the analysis with different di-tau kinematic fits and compared their search sensitivities.

Figure \ref{fig:ap7_ttmass_removedchi2} - \ref{fig:ap7_ttmass_mmc} shows the distributions of $m_{\tau,\tau}$ and $p_{T,\tau}$ using different method in hadronic channel. Good agreement between data and background predictions are achieved.

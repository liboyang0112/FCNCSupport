\section{Pruning and Correlation matrix}
The pruning algorithm removes systematic uncertainties that have a  $\leqq 1\%$ impact on normalisation or those that cause a negligibly small impact on the shape of the final discriminant (all bins are within $1\%$ of the nominal shape). A summary of the pruned nuisance parameters is provided in this appendix.
The corresponding correlation matrix for the fitted nuisance parameters can also be found here. The corresponding NP pull, constrain and correlations are shown below.

Pruning setting  which is chosen to be 0.1\% is also investigated, the final limit results in hadronic channel is found here in Table~\ref{tab:limit_pruned}. From the table, small influence is observed.

reduction with respect to the original uncertainty. The nuisance parameters are sorted according to the post-fit effect of each on $\mu$ (hashed blue area),

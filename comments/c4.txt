Dear convenors,

   Thank you so much for your comments. We have addressed these comments in the inter-note V5 uploaded in CDS.
   1) Added PS and ME systematics for ttbar sample as well as correlated systematics for the FCNC top decay signal.
   2) Updated the plots to use the top group blinding strategy. 
   
   We also included the answers to your questions below as starting "===>" and let us know
   in case of any further questions.

   thanks,
   FCNC Htautau Analysis team.
   
Dear Analysis team, 

Thank you for the updated note! We went through it quickly and we have a few main comments that we would like to try to address/consider
before we proceed with the EB request. We will post more detailed and less critical comments towards the end of the week. 

===> Thanks

1- Systematic uncertainties:

Section 11.4 Theoretical uncertainties on the background - mainly on ttbar

Any reason to not first consider the samples we have for the generator/ME uncertainty ?  you mention on line 845-847 that you want to 
consider using the Sherpa samples which we assume are the new Sherpa 2210 samples since the older version os Sherpa (221) is not available 
for mc16e. We are happy to see that you plan to explore these new samples but as you might already know we are still waiting on the MC-to-MC SFs. 
Meanwhile why don't you try the various options we have with the available samples? any reason not to? We have samples to try these various 
options: 

===> Thanks for the suggestions and we have implemented PS and ME ttbar systematics in V5 Line 852-860

a- PW+PY8 vs amc@NLO+PY8 (which is disfavoured due to MEC on/off in the different setups)

b- amc@NLO+PY8 versus amc@NLO+H7

c- PW+PY8* versus amc@NLO+PY8 (MEC is handled the same in both setups).

===>Done, the difference between aMCPythia(410464/5) and MECoff(411288/9) used as "ME"

Also, for the parton shower uncertainty we do have the samples and we don't expect anything to change with respect to the recommended 
PW+PY8 versus PW+H7. Any reason to not include this already? 

===> Done, the difference between nominal(410470) and PW+H7(410557/8) used as "PS"

Section 11.5 Uncertainties in the signal modelling

You only mention PDF, alpha_s, ISR, FSR, and scale. Any plans to include parton shower or generator/ ME uncertainty? 
Do you plan to request samples? If so we encourage you to start with the MC request. As you know, MC requests take some time. 

===> Yes, we have included the parton shower and generator/ME uncertainties derived from the ttbar sample for the signal.
     They are treated fully correlated between ttbar and signal in the fit. See Lines 866-869 in V5. 
     
2- Blinding strategy (section 4.5)

You mention on line 194 that the blinding threshold is quantified as significance reaching 1sigma when assuming B(t->Hq) is 0.2%. Any reason to not consider the recommended blinding strategy by the TOP group which is simply blinding bins where MC S/B > 0.1? Did you study this option and decided to not use it? If, so please add some explanation in the note. 

===> We have changed our blinding strategy to follow the top group recommendation, see Line 202-204 in V5.

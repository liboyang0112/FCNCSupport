Dear Analysis team,
 
thanks for providing the draft of the INT note of this particularly interesting analysis.
I would have liked to post my comments before, but it took a bit of time to group them together.
You can find them below:
 
FCNC DRAFT 5.2 09/07/21
 
* Eq1,2: is the “i” index the family generation? Please specify.
 
* l145: I think it would be more coherent and logical if you use 0.1% as BR benchmark. I understand where 0.2% is coming from, but 0.1% is used for the blinding and it also makes easier to convert the results on mu into the results on BR.
 
* l146: Have you considered the effect that a FCNC tHq contribution would have on the Higgs boson branching ratios? Likely negligible, but please think a little about it.
 
* Table 1: When a W decays into a tau, where do you account it in this table?
 
* Table 3: I mention it here, but it is also valid for other summary tables in the note (Tab 6,7,10,11,13,15,...). I find that the tables can be improved in several aspects:
- Make clear the rows that are the sum of other processes. For example, you can indent the background, data and merged signals to the left and the others to the right or central, you could also use multiple \hline to separate bkg from data from signal.
- the labels used for the process not very clear. What goes into “Other MC” or “Other fake tau”? What is “Rare”? What is “only t_sub real”? What is “Fake” wrt other types of Fake?
- Can you specify what tye of error is quoted (stat only, stat+syst, etc)?
- You can keep the current rounding for the INT note, but you will need a better rounding for the paper.
 
* l211: quote the minimum RNN cut, which is 0.01 AFAIK.
 
* l265: I think there is something wrong in the luminosity. Can be in the values you quote, the values you use or the GRL you used or any combination in between. If you are using some general Top group ntuples/prescription, please check with the responsible person.
- For 2016 you quote 32.88 ifb, but this is the one from tag Ofl-lumi-13TeV-008, which is for R20.7! The latest value for R21 is from tag Ofl-lumi-13TeV-009 and it is 32.9881 ifb
- For 2018 you quote 59.937 ifb. This value was obtained 19/02/2019 and corresponds to Ofl-lumi-13TeV-010. But there is a more recent value of 58.450 ifb obtained on 18/03/2019 also corresponding to Ofl-lumi-13TeV-010. I’m not sure what is the difference between the two, but I think that analyses are using the latter one. Can you please check?
The above values have been obtained from here: /cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/sw/database/GroupData/GoodRunsLists/
 
* l297: How large is the contribution of FCNC HWW and HZZ? You could quote the”Other Higgs decay modes” FCNC signal separately in the tables.
 
* l470: Are you doing or considered OR-ing of the triggers? Possibly you can gain a quite a bit in acceptance, if SFs are available.
===> doing OR-ing of the triggers
 
* l501: how much do you loose in acceptance by cutting on the jet pT > 60 GeV?
 
* l502: It is not clear to which signal region these cuts are applied to. top_lep or top_had or ….?
 
* l508: Before mentioning mtautau, you should discuss the tautau mass reconstruction (collinear mass) and how much the presence of neutrinos from leptonic decays of B-hadrons in b-jets affects the resolution. I also think that you don’t use mtautau for top_lep channel (hence my previous comment on specifying the regions), because the presence of neutrino from W decay completely spoils the collinear assumption.
===> We didn't use the collinear assumption when W decays leptonically.
 
* l509: Is the mtop mass already defined at this point?
 
* l520: Can you comment if 70%WP is optimal. You require exactly 1 b-jet.
 
* Eq3: I think you need to better describe the resolution terms and also mfitH, which is apparently the collinear mass you called in a different way in l508. I’m also a bit skeptical of using this chi2, because it shapes the background to peak at 125 GeV. So I think you should comment a bit more on the improvement that it brings in sensitivity and if it bias the background to be more signal-like for the BDT or if you took special care to avoid it.
 
* Figs in general: Please add to the caption the type of the error. As a rule of thumb, you should show all the variables used in the BDT. Also captions are often very brief. You should say when blinding is applied and perhaps indicate it better in the plot. Otherwise the reader doesn’t know if a bin is empty or blinded.
 
* Fig8: There are some data/MC fluctuations. I wonder if you have investigated them.
 
 
* Fig18: Here it is a bit disappointing/worrying that most of the bins in the distributions are blinded. I wonder if you have a CR that could be useful to check toplep_tauhad_tauhad agreement. It is the most sensitive region, I believe, and we have no idea of the data/bkg modelling.
 
* Fig24: I don’t understand the bottom figures. Are all the bins blinded or are they empty?
 
* l624: what makes the remaining 30% contribution? Please discuss this further.
 
* l677: Would be possible to have an appendix explaining in more details how you obtain the 24 factors?
 
* l685: Can you explain better what is the benefit of separating the tau correction factors from the transfer factors? Could you obtain both at once?
 
* l732: Why not using a FF estimation also for the lep channels and use a different method instead (ABCD)?
===> due to the large statistics, in the derivation phase, we only keep the medium tau.
 
* l736: I would recommend to better structure this part. Mention the first systematic and show the systematic values, then the second systematic and the values, etc..
 
* l754: In principle you should not be optimizing on the same events used in the “test” sample, i.e. the events used in the statistical analysis. You should demonstrate that there is no bias or split like 40%/40% and 20% as “validation” sample for optimization studies. See action item from 1st EB meeting.
 
* l857: have you checked of different are 1p and 3p taus?
===> Checked in the note.
 
* Fig39-41: Are the bin contents divided by the bin width? You should specify in the caption. As mentioned, the captions are often very brief.
 
* Fig43-47: too much information given to the reader to digest. If there is some important important feature, please mention in the text/caption.
 
* Fig48: I see that ttbar theory uncert are often constrained (ME, PS, hdamp). I see why they are (figs 57-59), but is it expected?
 
* Fig48: Why Pileup_Rho_Topology is 1-sided? As a related remark,  could you add more details on the configuration used for TRexFitter in terms of pruning, symmetrization, etc?
 
 
Best Regards,
Luca.






Dear Analysis team,
Thanks for documenting this very interesting analysis
I have read the note and have compiled a first set of comments on v 5.2
General comment:
I recommend to change a bit the structure of the note regarding how the information is presented to the reader, I would move section 5 after section 10 (or rewrite it as a summary instead), in such a way that you start describing the pieces of the analysis first; starting from the physics objects and the analysis regions definitions, describing later how the background estimation and fits are performed in detail and finalizing with the limits results. Also I would recommend to condense and simplify the definition and naming of the many signal and control regions you use in the analysis, since sometimes they are difficult to follow, and try not to go into very detailed descriptions of some analysis features that are difficult to understand, instead of that try to always kept the descriptions as simple as possible and try to use diagrams or tables to explain more complex concepts in a compact way.
I would also move some of the yields tables to the appendix.

L168.- detected-> required
===> done

L176.- that one ->in which one of the taus
===> done

L188.- reducible or irreducible
===> done

Table 3.- You cannot look at data into signal region before unblinding, are these numbers considering the blinding? Also the table is not self explanatory so you might consider expanding the caption


Figure3.- Full Run 2 luminosity is 139 fb-1, not 140 fb-1, in these plots what do you mean by Rare?
===> Rare:single top, three top 

L204 the hadronic channels
===> done

L212.- 216.- This part seems disconnected from the previous paragraph, please consider improving this description of the control regions

L298.- Why there is no Run number here?
===> missing these numbers, done

L359.- elections->electrons
===> done

L387.- ttW multi-lepton analysis
===> done

L392.- group->analysis
===> done

L408.- that produced non-prompt leptons
===> done

L418.- muonss->muons
===> done

L427.- a overlapped second-layer cluster?
===> done

L438.- What do you mean by two leading here? or do you mean with any of the two leading?

L461.- Tight ID does not seems to be defined there

L495.- Do you mean the offline hadronic tau candidate right?

L503-509.- It is not clear what is the purpose of this region, it is a signal or a control region?

L511.- It is not clear how this CR is generated, could you please improve clarity here?

L527.- close
===> done

L537.- according to [61]
===> done

Figure 7.- It seems that what is plotted is not Enu but Evis-tau, at least this is what is shown in the labels, could you check please and make it consistent.
===> Here, not Enu,we mean Ev,which stands for Evisible.

L546.- what do you mean by a “huge degree of freedom”?
===> in the leptonic channel, the neutrino associated with lepton and with tau will spoil the collinear assumption,we cannot use the fit.

L549-551.- In addition to the explanation of each of the variables used for the BDTs you use in the different regions, it would be really nice to have a table showing exactly 
which set of variables is used to train the BDT in each region 
====> Please look at the importance tables(table21,table22), which shows various variables uesd in the BDT training. 

L576.- Visible or invisible?
===> Visible,here we mean tauhad or taulep

L578.- in this section->mentioned earlier in this section
===> done

Figure8.- There seems to be slopes in DRtautau and sigma ETmiss variables, I’m wondering if it worth to investigate that modeling?

Figure 13 (and others).- Why there is no peak at mt=175 GeV (or at 2 mt) in mt_SM for the ttbar background? Why some of the invariant mass plots have such large overflow bins? Also it doesn’t seems that you are applying the cuts of section 8.3. Also the backgrounds in the mtautau invariant mass as we discussed at the EB meeting seems to be sculpted by the Chi2 fit to have a peak around mtautau=125 GeV.

Figure 18.- There is quite some mismodeling in this region

Figure 20.- Which variables are leading and subleading bins, these does not seem to be described in the text?

L602.- represented by->estimated with
===> done

Figure 24.- Are you blinding also the SS CR data points? is your signal in these regions significant?

L674.- Which tool did you use to make the fit?
===> nou use a tool,just use chi2 fit via TMuinit.

L676.- depencence->dependence
===> done

L677.- …there are in total…
===> done

L679.- The scale factors are applied directly to the signal regions or a transfer factor is derived somehow?
===> applied directly to the signal regions

Figure 29.- Maybe add a label to the figures showing the low BDT cut, and write in the caption that this is a closure test

Table 13.- thtlepthad-2j  (3j) regions overall agreement is not so good

L734.- requirment->requirement
===> done

L766.- Corrected normalized->Correctly normalized?
===> done

L768.- since the fakes are modelled…
===> done

L793.- On the total number of signal events
===> done

L794.- the the-> the
===> done

L802.- related to detector effects
===> done

L805.- and taus?
===> done

L882.- Matric->Matrix
===> done

L885.- The the->The
===> done

L921->propogated->propagated
===> done

L931.-evalated->evaluated
===> done

L943.- themself->themselves
===> done

Unrelated: I’m wondering also why ttbar decaying to real taus normalization is not letting float in the background only fit as well


Maybe I'm mistaking here but I see all plots are made for the uH final state, but in the tables and the results you quote also que channel cH, did you derived those limits only by dividing the total branching ratios and then taking 1-BR(uH), or did you measure the cH final state directly?
===> measure the tcH directly,we didn't add the plots in the note.

Best regards,
Edson

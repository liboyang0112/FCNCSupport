\section{To do list}

Add signal samples used by FCNC $H\to multilepton$ group (Their AOD files are deleted, still not available).

Implementation of $t\bar{t}$ matrix element systematics (New samples? Not listed in the top systematics recommendation).
\section{Change log}

\subsection{From V1 to V2}

Leptonic channels:  80fb-1 $\to$ 140fb-1

BDT tau ID $\to$ RNN tau ID

Updates to PFlow jets with DL1r b-tagging.

Optimised event seletion.

Changed fake estimation method.

Added signal regions $l\tau$ 1j and $l\tau$ 2j.

\subsection{From V2 to V3}

Added to do list and change log.

Added Analysis outline section and moved signal region definition here.

Added yield tables for CRs.

Added plots for the variables defined.

Added closure test for ABCD method.

BDT optimisation.

\subsection{From V3 to V3.1}

Made the note more readable by introducing new names for SR and CR.

...
\subsection{From V3.1 to V4.0}

Updated with full systematics.

Improved figures, clarified a few statements.

Bug fix:

1. Add the missing Double fake contribution in $t_l\tauhad\tauhad$ regioninto the fit.

2. Require b-veto for the subleading tau in $t_l\tauhad\tauhad$ region

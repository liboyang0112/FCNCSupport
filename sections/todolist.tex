\section{To do list}

To be done in the next n-tuple version.

Add signal samples used by FCNC $H\to \gamma\gamma/bb$ group.

PLIV implementation.

Implementation of theory systematics and instrumental systematics. Including:

\begin{itemize}
	\item JES, JER
	\item flavor tagging
	\item JVT
	\item MET\_SoftTrk
	\item PRW
	\item Tau reconstruction, selection, identification, electron veto, TES
	\item Renormalisation and factorisation scale
	\item PDF
	\item $\ttbar$ and V+jets cross section
	\item ISR and FSR
\end{itemize}

Leptonic channels specific:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lepton trigger SF
	\item Electron reconstruction, identification, isolation
	\item Muon identification, isolation
	\item EG\_RESOLUTION, EG\_SCALE
\end{itemize}

Hadronic channels specific:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tau trigger SF
\end{itemize}

\section{Change log}

\subsection{From V1 to V2}

Leptonic channels:  80fb-1 $\to$ 140fb-1

BDT tau ID $\to$ RNN tau ID

Updates to PFlow jets with DL1r b-tagging.

Optimised event seletion.

Changed fake estimation method.

Added signal regions $l\tau$ 1j and $l\tau$ 2j.

\subsection{From V2 to V3}

Added to do list and change log.

Added Analysis outline section and moved signal region definition here.

Added yield tables for CRs.

Added plots for the variables defined.

Added closure test for ABCD method.

BDT optimisation.

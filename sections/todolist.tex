\section{To do list}

Add signal samples used by FCNC $H\to multilepton$ group (Their AOD files are deleted, still not available).

\section{On going studies}

Investigate the constraints of $t\bar{t}$ matrix element and parton shower systematics.

Generate signal PS systematics samples.

Try out 7.1 Herwig sample.

Double check production and decay mode signal cross section.

Address detailed comments on V5.

\section{Change log}

\subsection{From V1 to V2}

Leptonic channels:  80fb-1 $\to$ 140fb-1

BDT tau ID $\to$ RNN tau ID

Updates to PFlow jets with DL1r b-tagging.

Optimised event seletion.

Changed fake estimation method.

Added signal regions $l\tau$ 1j and $l\tau$ 2j.

\subsection{From V2 to V3}

Added to do list and change log.

Added Analysis outline section and moved signal region definition here.

Added yield tables for CRs.

Added plots for the variables defined.

Added closure test for ABCD method.

BDT optimisation.

\subsection{From V3 to V3.1}

Made the note more readable by introducing new names for SR and CR.

...
\subsection{From V3.1 to V4.0}

Updated with full systematics.

Improved figures, clarified a few statements.

Bug fix:

1. Add the missing Double fake contribution in $t_l\tauhad\tauhad$ regioninto the fit.

2. Require b-veto for the subleading tau in $t_l\tauhad\tauhad$ region

\subsection{From V4.0 to V5.0}

Added PS and ME systematics for ttbar sample.

Using recommended blinding strategy.

\subsection{From V5.0 to V5.1}

Decorrelate PS and ME systematics between signal and ttbar.

Use AFII PowhegPythia* ttbar sample and AFII PowhegHerwig7 sample for PS uncertainty.

Added pruning plots.

Added appendices for:

1. Systematics variation comparison plots.

2. Pull and correlation matrix for the fits with different signal.

\subsection{From V5.1 to V5.2}

1. Use AFII 410470 vs AFII PowhegHerwig7.0 (410557/410558) for PS uncertainty.

2. Decorrelated the PS uncertainty between signal and ttbar background.

3. Added appendice F. the decorrelation studies between different signal regions to understand the source of over-constraining.

4. Fixed reference format.

\subsection{From V5.2 to V5.3}

1. Changed the default value of B(t$\rightarrow$Hq) from 0.2\% to 0.1\% to be consistent with the blind strategies.

2. Re-trained the BDT using the Ncuts and Ntree obtained from the optimization studies made based on independent Herwig7 samples.

3. Added appendice G for the comparison of the sensitivity using different di-tau kinematic fits with MMC and a colinear fit without Higgs mass constraint.

4. Moved some yields tables into appendice H.

5. Added appendice I for checks on the PLIV cut efficiencies for the e/mu from the tau decay using $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\rightarrow e\mu$ events.

6. Improved the table and figure captions to be more readable.

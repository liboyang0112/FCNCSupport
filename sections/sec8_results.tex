The significance of any small observed excess in data is evaluated by quoting the $p$-values to quantify the level of consistency of the data with the BR=0 hypothesis. The asymptotic approximation in \cite{CCGV} is used. The test statistic used for the exclusion limits derivation is the $\tilde{q}_\mu$ test statistic
and for the $p$-values the $q_{0}$ test statistic\footnote{The definition of the test statistics used in this search is the following:
\[ \tilde q_\mu = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    -2 \ln (\mathcal{L}(\mu,\hat{\hat{\theta}})/\mathcal{L}(0,\hat{\hat\theta})) & \quad \text{if $\hat\mu < 0$}\\
    -2 \ln (\mathcal{L}(\mu,\hat{\hat{\theta}})/\mathcal{L}(\hat \mu,\hat\theta)) & \quad \text{if $0 \leq \hat\mu \leq \mu$}\\
    0 & \quad \text{if $\hat\mu > \mu$}
  \end{array} \right.\]
and
\[ q_0 = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    -2 \ln (\mathcal{L}(0,\hat{\hat{\theta}})/\mathcal{L}(\hat\mu,\hat\theta)) &\quad \text{if $\hat\mu \geq 0$}\\
    0 & \quad \text{if $\hat\mu <0$}
  \end{array} \right.\]
where $\mathcal L(\mu,\theta)$ denotes the binned likelihood function, $\mu$ is the parameter of interest (i.e.
the signal strength parameter), and $\theta$ denotes the nuisance parameters. The pair $(\hat\mu, \hat\theta)$
corresponds to the global maximum of the likelihood, whereas $(x, \hat{\hat\theta})$ corresponds to a conditional
maximum in which $\mu$ is fixed to a given value $x$.

The $95\%$ CL upper limits on $tqH$ interaction with BR$(t\to Hq)=0.1\%$ as reference are given in Table~\ref{tab:tab_tthML_limit} and \ref{tab:tab_xTFW_limit} (Table \ref{tab:tab_tthML_limit_statsOnly} and \ref{tab:tab_xTFW_limit_fakeOnly} are limits with only fake estimation method and statistical uncertainties included.) for leptonic and hadronic channels respectively. The expected limits combining all channels are given in Table \ref{tab:limit} (Table~\ref{tab:limit_statsOnly} are limits with only fake estimation method and statistical uncertainties included.) and Figure \ref{fig:combined_limit}. The sensitivity is significantly improved compared to the published results~\cite{fcncgmgm,fcncml,fcnctautau}. 

Upper limits on the branching ratios BR$(t\to Hq)$ ($q=u,c$) can be translated into upper limits on the dimension-6 (D6) operator wilson coefficients appearing in the effecitive field theory Lagrangian for $tqH$ interaction in Eq.~\ref{eq:eq01}.
The branching ratio BR$(t\to Hq)$ is estimated as the ratio of its partial width to the SM $t \to Wb$ partial width including next-to-leading-order QCD corrections and the coefficients can be extracted as $C_{q\phi} = \sqrt{1946.6~\text{BR}(t\to qH)}$.
The $C_{q\phi}$ coefficient corresponds to the sum in quadrature of the cofficients relative to the two possible chirality combinations of the quark fields,
$C_{q\phi} =\sqrt{(C^{i3}_{u\phi})^2 + (C^{3i}_{u\phi})^2}$~\cite{fcnc_production_theory}. The observed (expected) upper limits on the D6 Wilson coefficients from the combination of the searches are $C_{c\phi}<xxx\,(0.95)$ and $C_{u\phi}<yyy\,(0.81)$.

A similar set of results can be obtained by simultaneously varying both branching ratios in the likelihood function. Figure~\ref{fig:combined_2D_limit}(left) shows the 95\% CL upper limits on the branching ratios in theB($t\rightarrow Hu$)
versus B($t\rightarrow Hc$) plane. The corresponding upper limits on the D6 Wilson coefficients couplings in the $C_{u\phi}$ versus $C_{c\phi}$ plane are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:combined_2D_limit}(right).
%The values of the branching ratio limits obtained in the two-dimensional scan on the x- and y-axes is in coincidence with that presented in Table \ref{tab:limit}.

The search for the FCNC decay $t\to Hq, H\to\tau\tau$ with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using 13~\TeV{} data was presented in this note. The best-fit values for BR($t\to Hc$) and BR($t\to Hu$) are found to be $X.XX^{+X.XX}_{-X.XX}\%$ and $X.XX^{+X.XX}_{-X.XX}\%$ respectively, based on 139 $\ifb$ of data collected from 2015 to 2018. The observed (expected) $95\%$ CL upper limits on BR($t\to Hc$) and BR($t\to Hu$) are found to be $X.XX\%$ ($0.046^{+0.019}_{-0.013}\%$) and $X.XX\%$ ($0.034^{+0.014}_{-0.010}\%$), respectively.

%The best asimov fit values with S+B hypothesis are given in Table~\ref{tab:tab_best_fit}.
%Note that the current results only consists of fake estimation NPs.

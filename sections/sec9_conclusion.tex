A search is presented for flavor-changing neutral currents $tqH$ interactions with $H\to\taup\taum$ using a data set collected with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $139$~fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV.
%The search is performed in the decay chain $t\bar{t} \to Wb+Hq$ or $qg \to tH \to Wb+H$ ($q=c/u$), where the $W$ boson decays inclusively and
%H decays to $\taup\taum$. 
The search targets top quark pair production with one top decaying to Wb and the other to Hq, and single $qg \to tH$($q=c/u$) single top production in association with a Higgs boson. All W-boson decay modes are considered, while the Higgs boson is assumed to decay to a $\taup\taum$ pair. Leptonic($\tau \rightarrow \ell v_{\ell} v_{\tau}$) and hadronic($\tau \rightarrow hardrons v_{\tau}$) decays of the $\tau$ lepton are considered.
Multivariate analysis based on BDT is conducted to improve the discrimination between the signal and the backgrounds. Preliminary expected exclusion limits on the signal cross section are derived using the profile likelihood fit and CLs method. Upper limits at 95~\% confidence level for the corresponding $t\to cH$ and $t\to uH$ decay branching ratios are measured to be $XXX$ and $XXX$, while the expected limits are $0.046^{+0.019}_{-0.013}\%$ and $0.034^{+0.014}_{-0.010}\%$), respectively, which are nearly improved by a factor of 5 compared to the partial run2 analysis.

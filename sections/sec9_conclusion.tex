\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A search is presented for flavor-changing neutral currents $tHq$ interactions with $H\to\taup\taum$ using a data set collected with the ATLAS
detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $139$~fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV.
The search is performed in the decay chain $t\bar{t} \to Wb+Hq$ or $qg \to tH \to Wb+H$ ($q=c/u$), where the $W$ boson decays inclusively and
H decays to $\taup\taum$. Upper limits at 95~\% confidence level for the corresponding $t\to cH$ and $t\to uH$ decay branching ratios are measured
to be $XXX$ and $XXX$, while the expected limits are $0.046^{+0.019}_{-0.013}\%$ and $0.034^{+0.014}_{-0.010}\%$), respectively.
